# Samvera Connect 2019 Stimulus and Webpacker Workshop

_This workshop largely based on the work of Noel Rappin, who taught a similar
workshop at RailsConf 2019_

In order to run this application, you need SQLite on your
machine. The application comes with a pre-seeded SQLite database.

This application does not specify a Ruby version, for ease of install.
It was developed with Ruby 2.6.4, but should run with any
version of Ruby 2.5 and up (which is the prerequisite for Rails 6.0).

In order to get set up, you should do the following

1. Clone and download this repository
2. In the directory for this repo, make sure you are running Rails 2.5 or up
3. run `bundle install`
4. run `yarn`
5. go to http://localhost:3000
6. You should see a webpage that looks like a schedule
